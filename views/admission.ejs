                        I hope these pages will capture your imagination and give you some insights into this remarkable
                        school. For over 160 years, Jaipuria has touched the lives of young people from all corners of
                        the globe and from all walks of life who have come to this place to live and learn together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="principal-text">
                        A Jaipuria education combines the very best features of high academic challenge with a unique
                        approach to the enrichment and personal development of young people. We prepare young people for
                        exams and we equip them to earn a living — we do these things with rigour, nurturing the
                        potential and achievement of each individual. Yet the education Jaipuria offers is designed to
                        go far beyond these goals, to develop the whole person and not just a part, to help each
                        individual to become, in the words of our mission statement, ‘visionary, articulate and ethical
                        — equipped to achieve their full potential in leadership and in life’.
                    </p>
                    <p class="principal-text">
                        Jaipuria is not an easy option; the challenges are real and the expectations high. From our
                        stunning Himalayan location, we are uniquely placed to span many of the divides that still
                        dominate the 21st century, divides between east and west, rich and poor, creed, culture and race
                        — an inspiring mix of opportunity and challenge. But this is also an immensely rewarding and
                        fulfilling option. For young people excited by the possibility of change and motivated to act
                        through personal example and courageous leadership, there are real opportunities to make a
                        difference.

                    <p class="principal-text">
                        Visitors to our campus discover the friendly and dynamic atmosphere that makes this such a
                        fascinating place. There is an air of happy purposefulness here, a determination to succeed, to
                        enjoy life, to enjoy each other’s company and, most importantly, to discover that there is far
                        more in each of us than we think!
